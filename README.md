# Umarket
<h2>Umarket, an online web store project</h2>
This is my first huge personal Full Stack project after finishing my first Udemy course .

"The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021" by Colt Steele.

Umarket is an online shopping store.
It is made using:
- HTML and CSS with a little bit of Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript for Front End.
- NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB for Back End.

The project is commited to this repository a bit later after it was started due to my lack of knowledge about GITHUB.
